### 🎂🔥 Birthday Cake Candles & Dominator 🔢📊  

This repository contains solutions for two algorithmic challenges:  

1. **Birthday Cake Candles** 🎂  
2. **Dominator** 📊  

## 🚀 Project Overview  

### 🎂 Birthday Cake Candles  

In this problem, the goal is to determine how many candles of the maximum height can be blown out on a birthday cake. Additionally, the algorithm checks whether these tallest candles are placed symmetrically and adjusts them if necessary.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Count the number of the tallest candles.  
- Check if they are symmetrically placed.  
- Adjust positions to ensure symmetry if required.  

📌 **Example:**  
```python
Input: candles = [4, 4, 1, 3]  
Output:  
Max height: 4  
Number of tallest candles: 2  
Is symmetric: False  
```

### 📊 Dominator  

The **Dominator** problem requires finding the element that appears in **more than half** of an array’s elements. If no such element exists, the algorithm returns `-1`.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Identify the dominator element (if present).  
- Optimize performance for large datasets (up to 100,000 elements).  
- Return any valid index of the dominator element.  

📌 **Example:**  
```python
Input: A = [3, 4, 3, 2, 3, -1, 3, 3]  
Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 7]  # Indices where the dominator (3) appears
```
