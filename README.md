🎂🔥 **Birthday Cake Candles Project** 🔥🎂  

Imagine you’re in charge of a child’s birthday cake, where there’s one candle for each year of their age. However, the child can only blow out the tallest candles! 🕯️✨  

In this project, we developed an algorithm that:  
✅ Counts the number of the tallest candles 🔢  
✅ Checks if the tallest candles are symmetrically placed around the center of the cake 🎂  
✅ Adjusts the positions to make the arrangement symmetrical if necessary 🔄  

🚀 **The main challenge?** Optimizing performance to handle a large number of candles efficiently!

📊🔢 **Dominator Project** 🔢📊  

Ever wondered which element dominates a dataset? In the **Dominator** project, we designed an algorithm to find the element that appears in more than half of a given array!  

💡 **Goal**: Efficiently identify the dominant element (if it exists) even in large datasets!  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
✅ Quickly finding the dominator element ⚡  
✅ Supporting large datasets with up to 100,000 elements 📈  
✅ Efficiently indexing positions where the dominant element appears 🔍
